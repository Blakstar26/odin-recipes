        <h3>Traditional Jamaican Curry Chicken Recipe</h3>

        <p>There’s nothing more comforting than chicken and potatoes, and this recipe is no exception. Getting its flavor and heat from a combination of mild Jamaican curry powder and Scotch bonnet pepper, it’s not as hot as some Indian or Thai curries.</p>

        <p>Jamaican curry powder tends to be heavy on turmeric and less on spice, and this recipe uses just one Scotch bonnet pepper, which is kept whole but punctured to gently release flavor. The result is more warming than spicy. Eat this one-pot recipe by itself as a kind of stew, or over rice, letting all the flavors meld together.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken (about 2.5lb - 3lb)</li>
